# Active verbs in past tense

## First things first: Word's root

To make the past tense in Greek we first need to know what the root of word is: it's the invariant part of  
a work Let's see some examples  

| Subject  		| Verb (**root**)	|
| ------------- | ------------------|
| εγώ  			| **διαβάζ**ω  		|
| εσύ  			| **διαβάζ**εις  	|
| αυτός/ή/ό  	| **διαβάζ**ει 		|
| εμεις  		| **διαβάζ**ουμε	|
| εσεις  		| **διαβάζ**ετε  	|
| αυτοί/ές/ά  	| **διαβάζ**ουν  	|

Then we have to make distinction between two types of roots:  
- Continuous root: Represents an action that lasts in the time
- Punctual root: Represents an action that happens only once, or in given ocassions


## How do we put verbs into past tense

We can use the following pattern to bring verbs into past tense

```
past tense = verb's root + (root's modification) + (past endings) + change of accent if applies 
```

### Root's modification

We have three different types of verb depending on which letter do they end, each one will modify the root of the word in a different way.

- -ω  
	Verbs finishing in ω will apply the following rule to substitute the ω in the root of the verb in case the root verbs finished like the mentioned rule

| Rule  					| substitution		| Hint							|  
| --------------------------| ------------------|-------------------------------|
| Vowel, ν, ζ 				| **σ**				|								|
| γ, γγ, κ , χ, χν			| **ξ**				| sounds made with the throat	|
| π, β, φ,. Πτ, φτ, αυ, ευ 	| **ψ**				| sounds made with the lips		|

So for example διαβάζω which it's active root is *διαβαζ* will be transformed into **διαβασ**


- -ώ and -αω
	Root verbs finishing in -ώ and -αω can modify the root of the verb in three different ways which are -ης, -αξ, -ας unfurtonately there is no rule for this case so you will have to learn it by heart :)

	There you go with some examples  
	* Αγαπάω 	-> αγάπησ
	* Κοιτάζω 	-> κοίταξα

### Word's ending in the past

| Subject  		| Verb 		| Ending 	| Result 		|
| ------------- | ----------|-----------|---------------|
| εγώ  			| διαβάς	|	α		| **διαβάσα**	|
| εσύ  			| διαβάς	|	ες		| **διαβάσες**	|
| αυτός/ή/ό  	| διαβάς	|	ε		| **διαβάσε**	|
| εμεις  		| διαβάς	|	αμε		| **διαβάσαμε**	|
| εσεις  		| διαβάς	|	ατε		| **διαβάσατε**	|
| αυτοί/ές/ά  	| διαβάς	|	αν		| **διαβάσαν**	|

### Change the position of the accent

Words written in past tense in greek always have the accent in the penultimate syllable of the word. So if we take the table above we will sport that there are some words that are wrong

| Not correct 	|	Correct		|
|-----------	|---------------|
| διαβάσα		| διάβασα		|
| διαβάσες		| διάβασες		|
| διαβάσε		| διάβασε		|
| διαβάσαμε		| διαβάσαμε		|
| διαβάσατε		| διαβάσατε		|
| διαβάσαν		| διάβασαν		|

#### What happens if there is no penultimate syllable?

In case there is no penultimate syllable, we will add an ε at the beginning of the work and we will put the accent right there, for example

Write => γράφω => γράψ => γράψα

As we can see there is no penultimate syllable in the word γράψα so we will use the rule mentioned above _et voila_: έγραψα
